# Facial Analysis Program

---

## Objective

- The objective of this program is to display a visual representation of the original image and the projected image side-by-side.


## Dataset

- The program will be using part of the [Yale face dataset](http://vision.ucsd.edu/~leekc/ExtYaleDatabase/ExtYaleB.html).
- The dataset format is npy format.
- The dataset contains 2414 sample images, each of size 32 × 32.

## Main Concepts & Equations

- In this facial analysis program, various concepts from linear algebra and pca will be applied.
- Will use n to refer to the number of images (so n = 2414) and d to refer to the number of features for each sample image (so d = 1024 = 32×32).
